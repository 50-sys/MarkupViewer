FIXME (1)
  ☐ .\MarkupViewer.py:207" actually need to filter all parents (not only BODY) or something, e.g. <ul> is the issue (and I don’t even want to try it with tables)"
TODO (5)
  ☐ .\MarkupViewer.py:111" add commandline parameter to force specific geometry"
  ☐ .\MarkupViewer.py:133" ¿ non-default browser @settings ?"
  ☐ .\MarkupViewer.py:246" statistics — decimals is a huge problem"
  ☐ .\MarkupViewer.py:322" hide menu?"
  ☐ .\MarkupViewer.py:436" make a proper error message"

File:
  ☐ open [ctrl+o]
  ☐ do something with print [pyqt’s default is awful]
    wxPython has nice one, but it should be better — think Firefox

CSS:
  ☐ real GitHub theme, pixel-perfect
  ☐ other themes ¿ Bitbucket, Solorized, Dark ?
    JODYHiGHROLLER theme — oh, I gotta make it ☺
    or maybe… DA THEME FO REAL PLAYAZ
  ☐ staff css files, e.g. keep the current theme but set all margins to zero [probably new menu View]
  ☐ scrollbar @win8

WebView:
  ☐ reload → update [f5]
  ☐ zoom in/out
  Selection:
    ☐ statistics
    ☐ copy as html/rtf
  ☐ GitHub emojicons :tophat: yes, please!!
  ☐ validate links

Search:
  ☐ make behavior of search more predictable [it sucks currently, tbh]
    e.g. if sth is found, user press highlight, press it again, search moves to the next result — it ought to stay where it was
  ☐ next/prev buttons [enter, shift+enter]
    why keybindings in PyQt/Qt are so stupid? even Tkinter is much better on this matter

App [overall]:
  ☐ toc in sidebar [optional]
  ☐ remember/restore state of each widget
  ☐ ¿recently used docs?
  ☐ make exe
  ☐ installer
  ☐ ¿ github pages ?
  ☐ ¿ linux ?

Archive:
  ✔ print [ctrl+p] @project(File)
  ✔ scroll to changed part [seems tricky] @project(WebView)
  ✔ remember/restore geometry in/from @settings
  ✔ find some monochrome icons [16×16px] @project(Search)
  ✔ save [ctrl+s] @project(File)
    as html, docx, other formats pandoc supports
  ✔ meta action for ESC key: hide search panel, then close the window
  ✔ edit [ctrl+e] @project(File)
    get editor from settings, fallback to notepad.exe
  ✔ settings/prefs [ctrl+t] @project(File)
  ✔ tooltip for links @project(WebView)
  ✔ generating toc is not reliable @bug @project(WebView)
    e.g. pandoc places <h> within <header> if title block is in md file
    apparently, user may place <h> within other tags using inline html
  ✔ need to wait until page loaded before count words @bug @project(WebView)
  ✔ drag&drop @project(WebView)
  ✔ improve Github-akin theme @project(CSS)
  ✔ new name [due to support other formats] @project(App [overall])
  ✔ full path / only name @settings
  ✔ support all formats pandoc_readers support @project(WebView)
    and more, e.g. creole isnt in pandoc currently
  ✔ settings (renderer, its arguments, init css) ¿YAML?
    ¡YAML!
  ✔ plugins @settings
  ✔ toc needs handle updates properly instead of spawn dups @project(WebView)
  ✔ load local pics w/o full path @project(WebView)
